**Senior Frontend / Software Engineer**  
Product-focused • React • TypeScript • Frontend-heavy Full Stack

### 👋 About

I build **product-quality web applications** with a strong focus on clarity, performance, and long-term maintainability.

Most of my experience is in **React and TypeScript**, working on real-world SaaS platforms where frontend complexity is non-trivial — large surfaces, evolving requirements, and trade-offs that matter. I enjoy owning features end-to-end and collaborating closely with product and design to ship things that last.

**Frontend**
- React, TypeScript

**Frontend-leaning Full Stack**

### 🔍 How I approach engineering

- Product-driven, not framework-driven  
- Prefer clarity over cleverness  
- Care about how systems evolve, not just how they launch  
- Learn best by building, shipping, and iterating

### 🚀 Current focus

- Rebuilding my public GitHub with **intentional, production-style projects**

- Exploring senior frontend and frontend-heavy full-stack roles
